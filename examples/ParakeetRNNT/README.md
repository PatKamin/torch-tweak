# Nemo ASR Parakeet RNNT 1.1B Pipeline Tuning with Torch Tweak

This example demonstrates how to use Torch Tweak to tune the Nemo ASR with Parakeet RNNT 1.1B model.

## Environment Setup

You can use either of the following options to set up the environment:

### Option 1 - virtual environment managed by you

Activate your virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu \
        --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \
        .
```

### Option 2 - virtual environment managed by `uv`

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage

### Sample audio file

The example uses a sample audio file that is **downloaded automatically** when you run the
commands below without an explicit `--audio_path`.
You can also download it manually:

```bash
wget https://dldata-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2086-149220-0033.wav
```

### Tuning and inference the model

To tune the ASR model, run:

```bash
tune
```

or

```bash
uv run tune
```

To infer the ASR model, run:

```bash
inference
```

or

```bash
uv run inference
```

To benchmark the ASR model, run

```bash
benchmark
```

or

```bash
uv run benchmark
```

#### Dynamic batching

The service uses dynamic batching - requests are grouped and processed together for efficiency. Currently, there is one frontend and one worker. To support multiple workers, move batching to a separate service that handles request grouping.
