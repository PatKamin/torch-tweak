# Commit Message Convention

Commit titles in this repository follow a lightweight variant of
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

- `<type>` is **required**.
- `(<scope>)` is optional but strongly encouraged when the change targets a
  specific area of the codebase.
- `<short description>` is a concise, lowercase imperative phrase (no trailing
  period). Aim for 72 characters or fewer for the whole title.

## Body and footer (optional)

When the title alone is not enough, add a blank line followed by a longer
description. Close issues or reference PRs in the footer:

```
fix(checkpoint): check zip file paths before extracting

ZIP entries with path-traversal sequences (../) could be silently
extracted outside the intended target directory. Validate each member
path against the destination root before extraction.

Closes #130
```
